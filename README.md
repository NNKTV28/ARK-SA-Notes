New MINI_MAP_ARTIFACTS_AND_CAVES.txt file uploaded, it does basically the same as the MINI_MAP_NOTES.txt but for caves and artifacts, to implement it
its the same method as shown above
New DISABLE-AUTO-BRIGHTNESS.txt file added, it disables automatic brightness, to use it just copy paste the code  at the end of the GameUserSettings.ini file
